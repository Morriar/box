# Ouija@home

Language: C

Ghosts, spirits, dead people. They are with us.

This application uses the latest breakthroughs in holistic cryptography to decipher messages that out-of-this-world beloved phantoms tries to communicate to us.

By default, the application tries to extract meaningful messages from `/dev/urandom` as it is nowadays the most efficient channel that spirits use to communicate with simple mortals.

If a media file that features a recently deceased person is given (photography, audio, video, animated gif) the software tries to gather remnant aura and transcript them into a meaning full message. Results may vary.

Disclaimer: the user need to be open minded and must truly believe in esoteric powers ; the software is only a tool that channel mystic energy and is not functional if bad energy is present. A nonbeliever is not expected to see any meaningful messages from the afterlife.

For a more efficient use, it is suggested to pipe the application in the command `strings(1)` to filter out spiritic noise.

## Examples

Without argument, it extracts meaningful messages from the afterlife trough `/dev/urandom`.

    $ bin/ouija | strings

Output:

It is suggested to start the ouija application automatically. Just put the following line in your `/etc/rc.local` file and regularly check the `/var/log/ouija.log` file.

	nice /path/to/ouija | strings -n 8 >> /var/log/ouija.log

With a media file of a recent decease person as argument, mystic aura is extracted (if any)
