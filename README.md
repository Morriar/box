# Box

Some notes I took on a meeting

## Use cases

### Students

* create team
* test / submit work (file / zip)
* comment submission
* submissions history

### Prof

* create box
* manage tests (public / private)
* test box submissions
* show box status / history
* show reports
* mail groupe
* add final correction

Random todo:
* we need to test a box (ie: to know if the box works independently of its submissions)
