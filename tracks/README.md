# Tracks

A track is a collection of highly related boxes.

A box is configured with an `track.ini` file that contains all the following meta-data:
* `id`: track unique identifier
* `title`: track title displayed in frontend
* `dependencies`: the list of tracks that must be unlocked by the student before trying this one
* `tags`: list of arbitrary strings
